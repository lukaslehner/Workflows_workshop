# Part I: General tools and workflow management

## Why should you care about your research workflow? {.flexbox .vcenter}

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/Comic_version_control.gif")
```

## Why should I learn yet another tool?

> -   Maintain an overview
> -   Access previous versions

¬†

> -   Strengthen Collaboration
> -   Foster Transparency

## Why should you care about reproducible research?

üôå Benefits yourself!

## Why should you care about reproducible research?

üöÄ That's the future of the social sciences!
üöÄ

. . .

-   Journals and funding agency requirements

-   Open science and data sharing

-   Easier collaboration and smoother workflows



## Literate Programming {.smallest}

:::{.fragment}
### Communication via code üó£Ô∏èüíª
Integrate computer code with software documentation in a single document


:::

:::{.fragment}

### Minimal requirements of high-quality code? üëÜ  
- executes what it supposed to execute   
- runs, no defects or problems, and runs not only under some circumstances  
- easy to read, maintain, and extend  

:::

# Folder structure: example

- [https://github.com/lukaslehner/Workflows_workshop/blob/main/D-Paper_folder.zip](https://github.com/lukaslehner/Workflows_workshop/blob/main/D-Paper_folder.zip)

# Naming conventions

- `snake_case`
- `camelCase`

# Relativ paths

- do not set a working directory (or only globally, at the very beginning of a script) ‚Üí documents should be **self-contained and portable**

- relative paths: `read.csv('./data/foo.csv')`

## How to design a well structured project directory? {.smallest .scrollable}

- use a naming convention that is...
    + **human readable**: directory names that are easy to understand for you & someone not familiar with the naming convention
    + **machine readable**: avoid spaces
    + **supports sorting**: sort list of input files   
    
. . .

- directory names that contain components of the project and can be referenced in the code (e.g. `figs`, `data`, etc.)

```
- ./data
    + `raw_data.csv`
    + `tidy_data.csv`
    + `codebook.txt`
- ./analysis
- ./figures
    + ./interaction_plot.png
    + ./bar_plot.png
- ./paper
- ./presentation
- ./README.md
```


# Tools

# Overleaf

# Zotero

# Note taking: md, Rmd, Qmd, ...

## Executible reports: Markdown, RMarkdown, and Quarto {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#what) as a human readable way to style text

-   "Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)." [John Gruber, founder of Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/)

-   R and RStudio (not the single [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) that supports RMarkdown, Visual Studio is also a great choice)

-   RMarkdown integrates R code into Markdown language through `knitr`

-   Quarto: extension of RMarkdown, optimised for language interoperability & CLI

-   Obsidian provides a neat user interface and search for Rmd

## Veracrypt

-   Container in Veracrypt =/ Container in Docker

-   Creates a virtual encrypted disk within a folder
